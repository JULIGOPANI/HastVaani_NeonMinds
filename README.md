## 🌍 Problem Statement

Despite the advancement in EdTech and AI tools, there is a significant lack of inclusive platforms designed for the deaf and mute community in India. People relying on **Indian Sign Language (ISL)** face communication barriers in daily life, education, and social interaction. Currently, most online learning tools are focused on verbal or textual learning, with no dedicated support for ISL-based education or translation. Moreover, these individuals often depend on human interpreters to communicate, making them less independent.

## 💡 Our Vision

We envision a world where **communication is accessible to everyone**, regardless of physical limitations. With **HastVaani**, we aim to:

- **Break communication barriers** between sign language users and the hearing community.
- **Empower the deaf and mute** with tools to express themselves independently.
- **Offer a fun, effective, and self-paced learning environment** tailored for ISL learners.
- Create awareness and promote sign language learning among everyone.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Sign Detection:**  
   Users perform signs in front of a webcam. MediaPipe captures hand landmarks in real-time.

2. **Model Prediction:**  
   A deep learning model (CNN + Transformer/LSTM) classifies the detected gesture into alphabets or words.

3. **Output Translation:**  
   The recognized signs are converted into text and audio using a speech synthesis engine.

4. **Animated Learning:**  
   Users can speak a word, which is converted to text and then visualized as an ISL animation by a 3D robot avatar.

5. **Multilingual Chatbot Assistance:**  
   A smart, voice-enabled chatbot available in 7+ languages helps users navigate the app and understand ISL.

6. **Word & Alphabet Prediction with LLM:**  
   Models predict signs and generate coherent sentences using large language models to improve communication context.

7. **User Engagement:**  
   The platform offers daily practice words, quizzes, and games to make ISL learning fun and effective.
