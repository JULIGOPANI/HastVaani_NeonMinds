## 🌍 Problem Statement

Despite the advancement in EdTech and AI tools, there is a significant lack of inclusive platforms designed for the deaf and mute community in India. People relying on **Indian Sign Language (ISL)** face communication barriers in daily life, education, and social interaction. Currently, most online learning tools are focused on verbal or textual learning, with no dedicated support for ISL-based education or translation. Moreover, these individuals often depend on human interpreters to communicate, making them less independent.

- **Break communication barriers** between sign language users and the hearing community.
- **Empower the deaf and mute** with tools to express themselves independently.

   A trained deep learning model (CNN + LSTM/Transformer) interprets the gesture.

3. **Output Translation:**  
   The recognized sign is converted into text and speech.

4. **User Engagement:**  
   Users can continue learning signs, take quizzes to test retention, and play games to reinforce concepts.
